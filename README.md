# EnergyCube Arduino Part

### -â€“> For the ESP Part see [here](https://github.com/PaulusElektrus/EnergyCube-ESP)

This is a code documentation for a battery storage system. The system is designed to control the charging and discharging of a battery based on commands received from an ESP device. It utilizes relays, PWM signals, and an ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter for measurements.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board
- ESP device
- ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter
- Relays for controlling power flow
- Resistors and capacitors as required for circuitry

## Libraries Used

- ADS1115_WE: This library provides an interface for the ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter.
- Wire: This library is used for I2C communication with the ADS1115 and other devices.

## Functions

- Relais Pins: These pins define the digital pins used for controlling the relays that control power flow.
- PWM Pins: These pins define the PWM pins used for controlling the charging and discharging power.
- ADS1115: This section includes the library and configuration for the ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter.
- Incoming Communication: These variables and functions handle communication with the ESP device.
- Incoming Data: These variables store the command and power data received from the ESP device.
- UART Timing: These variables control the timing of UART communication with the ESP device.
- Measurements: These variables store the measured values of voltage and current.
- Status: These variables track the status of the battery system.
- Control: These variables and functions handle the control of charging and discharging.
- Safety Parameters: These variables define the safety thresholds for various parameters.
- Setup: This function is called once at boot to initialize the system.
- Loop: This function is the main loop of the system, responsible for safety checks, receiving commands, and control.
- Safety Check: This function checks the safety parameters and takes appropriate actions if thresholds are exceeded.
- Get Command: This function receives commands and power data from the ESP device.
- Return Data: This function sends data back to the ESP device.
- Receive with Start/End Markers: This function receives data from the ESP device with start and end markers.
- Parse Data: This function parses the received data into command and power values.
- Control: This function determines the control action based on the received command and power values.
- Off: This function turns off all relays and resets system variables.
- Activate NT: This function activates the charger (NT) by turning on the necessary relays.
- Sync NT: This function syncs the charger with the battery voltage.
- Charge: This function controls the charging power based on the control target.
- Activate DC: This function activates the discharging (DC) by turning on the necessary relays.
- Discharge: This function controls the discharging power based on the control target.
- PWM Helper Functions: These functions help increase or decrease the PWM signals for controlling power.
- Measurement: This function reads the voltage and current measurements from the ADS1115.
- Read Voltage: This function reads the voltage measurement from the ADS1115.
- Read Current: This function reads the current measurement from the ADS1115.
- Debug PC: This function can be used for debugging by printing relevant system variables to the serial monitor.
